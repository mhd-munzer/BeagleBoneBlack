1-Bluetooth_adapter_reset.sh 

This shell script is used to solve a problem I faced with one kind of adapters, it was asking for a pairing key and showing the name of "Broadom bluetooth device". The problem only solved by unplugging then plugging the adapter, so this programm associated with a systemd service will solve this issue.
